Under development.

eight: Python 2 to the power of 3
=================================
Eight is a simple module that lets you write code for Python 3.3+ while making it compatible with Python 2.7. It's
inspired by `six <https://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_, but is more lightweight and unambiguously biased toward Python 3 code:
if you remove eight from your code, it will continue to function exactly as it did with eight on Python 3.

Installation

    pip install eight
